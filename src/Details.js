  about: `Hi, I'm Bhavesh Patidar from Indian Institute of Information Technology, Design and Manufacturing, Jabalpur. 
          A Full Stack Web Developer with a passion for crafting beautiful, responsive websites that make a difference for my clients. 
          With having experience and a love for all things tech, I'm always looking for new and innovative ways to improve my skills 
          and create cutting-edge designs.As a web developer, I understand that the key to a successful website is not just how it looks,
          but also how it functions. That's why I specialize in creating sites that are not only visually stunning but also intuitive
          and easy to use. I believe that a website should be a tool that helps businesses achieve their goals and connect with their audience,
          and I work tirelessly to make that a reality for every client I work with`,
